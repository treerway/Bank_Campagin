    "### Dataset\n",
    "For two projects in this class, you will pick your datasets. To receive full credit for this part, your datasets should satisfy the following conditions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- At least 15 features (columns)\n",
    "- At least 1000 instances (rows)\n",
    "- At least two categorical/ordinal columns.\n",
    "- Between 5 to 10 percent missing values across the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you should have two separate datasets one for classification and one for regression tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Description:\n",
    "- Read data into Jupyter notebook, use pandas to import data into a data frame\n",
    "- Preprocess data: Explore data, check for missing data and apply data scaling. Justify the type of scaling used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Task:\n",
    "- Apply all the regression models you've learned so far. If your model has a scaling parameter(s) use Grid Search to find the best scaling parameter. Use plots and graphs to help you get a better glimpse of the results. \n",
    "- Then use cross-validation to find average training and testing score. \n",
    "- Your submission should have at least the following regression models: KNN repressor, linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, polynomial regression, SVM both simple and with kernels. \n",
    "- Finally, find the best regressor for this dataset and train your model on the entire dataset using the best parameters and predict the target values for the test_set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification task:\n",
    "- Decide about a good evaluation strategy and justify your choice.\n",
    "- Find best parameters for the following classification models: KNN classification, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine, Kerenilzed Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree. \n",
    "- Which model gives the best results?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "- Submit IPython notebook. Use markdown to provide inline comments for this project.\n",
    "- Submit only one notebook. Before submitting, make sure everything runs as expected. To check that, restart the kernel (in the menubar, select Kernel > Restart) and then run all cells (in the menubar, select Cell > Run All).\n",
    "- Visualization encouraged. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions regarding the project:\n",
    "- Post your queries related to project on discussion board on e-learning. There is a high possibility that your classmate has also faced the same problem and knows the solution. This is an effort to encourage collaborative learning and also making all the information available to everyone. We will also answer queries there. We will not be answering any project related queries through the mail."
